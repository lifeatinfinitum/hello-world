# hello-world
A place to store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
It's never too late to learn something entirely new and different. Who knows, learning the world of the internet and computers could help me turn my friends' and sisters' dreams into reality, bringing visibility to their projects by creating websites devoted to Arab women artists, or to fun and unique antique pieces, spirituality, healing trauma, connections. I love that the sky is the limit and imagination with heart is the way.
